💬 **Summary**

This project was a great project for me in understanding how Vue.js works alongside CSS and HTML. I found Vue.js's component-based architecture to be a valuable addition to my tech skills. It provided a fresh perspective on how code can become more modular and easier to maintain. This project enhanced my foundation for understanding of frontend development.
